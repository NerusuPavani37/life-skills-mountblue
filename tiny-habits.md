# Tiny Habits & Atomic Habits Reflection

## 1. Most Interesting Idea from the Video

The concept of **"Tiny Habits"** by BJ Fogg stood out, particularly the **Maui Habit** anecdote. It demonstrated how starting with a small, achievable action—like saying "Today is going to be a great day" each morning—can lead to long-term behavioral change. The idea emphasizes that big transformations start with tiny, consistent steps.

## 2. Understanding B = MAP

BJ Fogg's behavior model, **B = MAP**, explains that for a behavior to occur, three elements must converge:

- **M** — Motivation: The desire to perform the behavior  
- **A** — Ability: The capacity to perform the behavior easily  
- **P** — Prompt: A trigger or cue to initiate the behavior  

To make habit formation easier, reduce the effort (increase ability), find the right time or trigger (prompt), and ensure motivation is present—even if it's low, ease of action can compensate.

## 3. Importance of Celebrating (“Shine”)

Celebration is a powerful reinforcement tool. By **"Shining"**—celebrating after completing a habit—you attach a positive emotion to the behavior. This emotional feedback strengthens the neural pathways involved, making the habit stick faster. **Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit** because your brain wants to feel that joy again.

## 4. Most Interesting Idea from Atomic Habits

The concept of **"1% Better Every Day"** was particularly impactful. It promotes continuous, incremental improvement rather than drastic changes, making personal growth more manageable and sustainable over time.

## 5. Book’s Perspective on Identity

*Atomic Habits* emphasizes that true behavior change is identity change. Instead of focusing on what you want to achieve, focus on **who you want to become**. For instance, instead of saying "I want to run a marathon," say "I am a runner." Aligning habits with identity leads to long-term consistency.

## 6. Making a Habit Easier to Do

To make habits easier, *Atomic Habits* suggests:

- **Start small**: Use the **Two-Minute Rule**—begin with just two minutes of the habit
- **Optimize your environment**: Remove friction and make the tools for your habit visible
- **Use habit stacking**: Pair the new habit with an existing one

## 7. Making a Habit Harder to Do

To break bad habits, increase friction:

- **Redesign your environment**: Remove triggers or cues
- **Add steps**: Make the behavior more difficult to access
- **Commitment devices**: Use tools or rules that lock you into a better choice (like app blockers)

## 8. New Habit to Build

**Desired Habit:** Daily Reading

**Strategies:**

- **Make the Cue Obvious**: Keep a book on your pillow or nightstand  
- **Make It Attractive**: Read genres or authors you enjoy  
- **Make It Easy**: Start with just 5 minutes a day  
- **Make the Response Satisfying**: Track your reading or reward yourself after finishing a chapter

## 9. Habit to Eliminate

**Habit to Reduce:** Excessive Screen Time

**Strategies:**

- **Make the Cue Invisible**: Keep devices in a drawer or another room  
- **Make It Unattractive**: Turn on grayscale mode to reduce appeal  
- **Make It Hard**: Log out of apps or use blockers like Screen Time  
- **Make the Response Unsatisfying**: Associate overuse with a penalty or reduce dopamine triggers
